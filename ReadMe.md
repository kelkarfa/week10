## Keyframes starter code 

This repository contains a quick example of how css properties can be manipulated with the use of @keyframes. The challenge of this assignment is to add in a landscape (green land with a few trees) and use @keyframes to time the covering of the sun with the clouds and then time the sun going down before returning ths sun and cloud to its original position. As the cloud covers the sun the landscapes color and sky should change (darker) and when the sun goes down those things shoule get even darker. 

An image of the rendering of the starer code looks like this.
