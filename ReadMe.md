4. (General Description of the assignment) This repository contains a quick example of how css properties can be manipulated with the use of @keyframes. The challenge of this assignment is to add in a landscape (green land with a few trees) and use @keyframes to time the covering of the sun with the clouds and then time the sun going down before returning ths sun and cloud to its original position. As the cloud covers the sun the landscapes color and sky should change (darker) and when the sun goes down those things shoule get even darker. 

5. A rendering of the starer code looks like the image below. You can remove the text - it just exists as an example of how @keyframes works.

6. Add a landscape with 3 "landscapey" things (can be just three trees). 

7. Use @keyframes to create a timeline which will include the movement of the clouds covering the sun, the sun going down until it has gone below the horizon line, the sun going back up to where it was in its original position behind the cloud, the cloud moving back to where it was originally. 

8. Use @keyframes to manipulate other html made elements (sky, landscape) so that their colors or brightness is impacted to coincide with the sun going behind the clouds and the sun going under the horizon line. 

9. Pass in your saved github repository link.
